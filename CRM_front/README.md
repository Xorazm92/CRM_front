### Instructions to Create the `.gitignore` File:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Create a new file named `.gitignore`:
   ```bash
   touch .gitignore
   ```
4. Open the `.gitignore` file in your preferred text editor and copy the above content into it.
5. Save the file.

This will help keep your Git repository clean by ignoring files that are not necessary for version control. Adjust the contents as needed based on your specific project requirements.
